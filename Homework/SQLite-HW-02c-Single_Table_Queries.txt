TSQL Homework 02c Chapter 02c, T-SQL Query Fundamentals

1. List the date/time types in T-SQL. 
DATETIME
SMALLDATETIME,
DATE
TIME
DATETIME2
DATETIMEOFFSET.

2. How do you express a date/time literal in T-SQL? 
It is a best practice to use character strings to express date and time values,
String literal yymmdd

3. What is the setting DATEFORMAT used for? 
DATEFORMAT determines how SQL Server interprets the literals you enter when they are converted from a character-string type to a date and time type.

4. Write a T-SQL snippet changing the date format to German. Read the documentation on how to do this. 
SET LANGUAGE German

5. What is the difference between CAST(), CONVERT(), and PARSE()? 
The SQL CAST Function converts an expression from one data type to another.
CONVERT function to explicitly convert the character-string literal to the requested data type and, in the third argument, specify a number representing the style you used.
Parse() Returns the result of an expression, translated to the requested data type in SQL Server.

6. What function returns the current date? This is very useful in a table that maintains a log of events, such as user logins. 
SELECT  GETDATE()
7. How do you add one day to the current date? Add one week? Add one month? Add one year? 
DATEADD(<Unit of time>, <Units>, <Date>)
-- to add 5 days to September 1, 2011 the function would be
DATEADD(DAY, 5, '9/1/2011')

-- to add 5 months from September 1, 2011 the function would be
DATEADD(MONTH, 5, '9/1/2011')
-- to add 5 months from September 1, 2011 the function would be
DATEADD(YEAR, 5, '9/1/2011')

8. Write a SQL snippet to return the number of years between your birth date and todayâ€™s date. 
SELECT DATEDIFF(year, getdate(), '19900604');

9. How do you check a string literal to see if it represents a valid date? 
ISDATE(string)

10. What does EOMONTH() do? Give an example of why this might be very useful. 
The EOMONTH function accepts an input date and time value and returns the respective end-of-month date as a DATE typed value.
Salaries are paid at the end of the month. So it can be useful to do so.

11. Payments are due exactly 30 days from the date of the last function. Write a select query that calculates the date of the next payment. Pretend we want to update a column in a database that contains the date of the next payment. We will do this when we write UPDATE queries.
UPDATE payments
SET nextpayement = DATEADD(DAY, 30, pastpayement);

 12. Suppose your son or daughter wants to run a query every day that tells them the number of days until their 16th birthday. Write a select query that does this.
SELECT DATEDIFF(day, getdate(), '20210604'); assuming 20210604 is the birthday date.
