TSQL Homework 06 Chapter 6, T-SQL Query Fundamentals Readings Read chapter 6 in the T-SQL Query Fundamentals book. Homework questions 

1. What does a set operator do? 
combine rows from two query result sets

2. What are the general requirements of a set operator
The general form of a query with a set operator is as follows:
 Input Query1<set_operator>
Input Query2[ORDER BY ...];
Same number of columns 
Compatible types of columns

 3. What is a Venn Diagram? This is not in the book. 
 is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets.

4. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION operator. What does it do? 
Figure 6-1

5. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION ALL operator. What does it do? 
Like Union but with the duplicated rows

6. Draw a Venn Diagram of the INTERSECT operator. What does it do? 
Figure 6-2

7. If SQL Server supported the INTERSECT ALL operator, what would it do? 


8. Draw a Venn Diagram of the EXCEPT operator. What does it do? 
Figure 6-3

9. If SQL Server supported the EXCEPT ALL operator, what would it do? 


10. What is the precedence of the set operators? 
The INTERSECT operator precedes UNION and EXCEPT, and UNION and EXCEPT are evaluated in order of appearance.

11. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is all elements in A that are also not in A and B, and all elements of B that are also not in A and B. For example, if set A consisted of all integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 2, and set B consisted of all integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 3, the symmetric difference of A and B would include all integers in A and B except integers divisible by both 2 and 3, e.g., 6, 12, 18, etc. Write a SQL query that computes the symmetric difference of two tables A and B.
A union B Except A intersect B
