TSQL Homework 03 Chapter 3, T-SQL Query Fundamentals

Homework questions 

1. In general, why would you even want to join two (or more) tables together? This is a good time to think about the nature of relational algebra.
To be able to read the relation between tuples from different tables. If we were to query columns specified on different tables but had a related foreign key.

 2. Describe in your own words the output from an inner join. 
The product is the join of attributes from two tables depending on the join ON condition, where this condition is true, usually a primary key related to a foreign key.

3. Describe in your own words the output from an outer join. 
The product is the join of attributes from two tables depending on the join ON condition, where this condition is not true. Left Join, Right Join Outer Join.

4. Describe in your own words the output from an cross join. 
The product is the join of attributes from two tables

5. A convenient mnemonic for remembering the various joins is “Ohio.” Why is this true? 


6. Give an example of a composite join.
From dbo.Table1 as T1
   Inner join dbo.Table2 as T2
      On T1.col1 = T2.col1
         AND T1.col2 = T2.col2




7. What is the difference between the following two queries? The business problem is “How many orders do we have from each customer?”
================first query=============== 
SELECT C.custid, COUNT(*) AS numorders 
FROM Sales.Customers AS C 
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O 
ON C.custid = O.custid
 GROUP BY C.custid; 	
================second query=============== 
SELECT C.custid, COUNT(O.orderid) AS numorders 
FROM Sales.Customers AS C 
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O 
ON C.custid = O.custid 
GROUP BY C.custid;

One counts the rows on the Customers table, the other counts the column orderid on the Orders table. The result should be the same.

8. What might be one reason the following query does not return the column custID in this query?
SELECT C.custid, C.companyname, O.orderid, O.orderdate 
FROM Sales.Customers AS C 
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O 
ON C.custid = O.custid 
WHERE O.orderdate >= ’20160101’;

Because of the where clause?
